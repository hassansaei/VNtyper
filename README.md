# VNtyper 2.0 - A Pipeline to genotype the MUC1-VNTR

**VNtyper 2.0** is an advanced pipeline designed to genotype MUC1 coding Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR) in Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD-MUC1) using Short-Read Sequencing (SRS) data. This version integrates enhanced variant calling algorithms, robust logging mechanisms, and streamlined installation processes to provide researchers with a powerful tool for VNTR analysis.

  - We have developed a web server to provide free access to VNtyper, which runs in the background for ease of use.

  - **SHARK (optional, FASTQ-only):** Rapid filtering and read extraction for MUC1 region in exome/whole-genome data.

- **Comprehensive Logging:**
  - Logs both to the console and a dedicated log file.
  - Generates MD5 checksums for all downloaded and processed files.

- **Flexible Installation:**
  - Supports installation via `pip` using `setup.py`.
  - Provides Conda environment setup for easy dependency management.

- **Subcommands:**
  - `install-references`
  - `pipeline`
  - `fastq`
  - `bam`
  - `kestrel`
  - `report`
  - `cohort`
  - `online`

## Installation

VNtyper 2.0 can be installed using either `pip` with `setup.py` or via Conda environments for streamlined dependency management.

### Using `setup.py` and `pip`

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   mkdir vntyper
   git clone https://github.com/hassansaei/vntyper.git
   cd vntyper
   pip install .
   ```

---

## Usage

VNtyper 2.0 offers multiple subcommands that can be used depending on your input data and requirements. Below are the main subcommands available:

### 1. Running the Full Pipeline

To run the entire pipeline using a BAM file:

```bash
vntyper --config-path /path/to/config.json pipeline \
    --bam /path/to/sample.bam \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --threads 4 --fast-mode
```

Alternatively, using paired-end FASTQ files:

```bash
vntyper --config-path /path/to/config.json pipeline \
    --fastq1 /path/to/sample_R1.fastq.gz \
    --fastq2 /path/to/sample_R2.fastq.gz \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --threads 4 --fast-mode
```

The adVNTR genotyping is optional and skipped by default. To enable adVNTR genotyping, use the `--extra-modules advntr` option.

**New**: To enable SHARK filtering on FASTQ reads *before* the usual QC and alignment (for improved MUC1 detection), add `shark` to the `--extra-modules` flag (e.g., `--extra-modules shark`). This can be done as:

```bash
vntyper --config-path /path/to/config.json pipeline \
    --fastq1 /path/to/sample_R1.fastq.gz \
    --fastq2 /path/to/sample_R2.fastq.gz \
    --extra-modules shark \
    --threads 4 \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir
```

- SHARK will run first on the raw FASTQ files to extract and filter reads covering the MUC1 VNTR region.  
- **Important**: SHARK is only supported in FASTQ mode. If you try to use `--extra-modules shark` together with `--bam` or `--cram`, VNtyper will exit gracefully with a warning.

Docker image for VNtyper 2.0 is provided and can be pulled and used as follows:

```bash
# pull the docker image
docker pull saei/vntyper:main

# run the pipeline using the docker image
docker run -w /opt/vntyper --rm \
    -v /local/input/folder/:/opt/vntyper/input \
    -v /local/output/folder/:/opt/vntyper/output \
    saei/vntyper:main \
    vntyper pipeline \
    --bam /opt/vntyper/input/filename.bam \
    -o /opt/vntyper/output/filename/
```

An Apptainer image can be generated from the Docker image as follows:

```bash
# create the apptainer sif image
apptainer pull docker://saei/vntyper:main

# run the pipeline using the apptainer image
apptainer run --pwd /opt/vntyper \
    -B /local/input/folder/:/opt/vntyper/input \
    -B /local/output/folder/:/opt/vntyper/output \
    vntyper_main.sif vntyper pipeline \
    --bam /opt/vntyper/input/filename.bam \
    -o /opt/vntyper/output/filename/
```

### 2. Installing References

```bash
vntyper --config-path /path/to/config.json install-references \
    --output-dir /path/to/reference/install \
    --skip-indexing  # Optional: skip BWA indexing if needed
```

### 3. Generating Reports

```bash
vntyper --config-path /path/to/config.json report \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir
```

## Pipeline Overview

VNtyper 2.0 integrates multiple steps into a streamlined pipeline. The following is an overview of the steps involved:

1. **FASTQ Quality Control**: Raw FASTQ files are checked for quality.  
2. **(Optional) SHARK Filtering**: If `shark` is specified in `--extra-modules`, raw FASTQ reads are first filtered to extract MUC1-specific reads (especially relevant for exome or large WGS datasets).  
3. **Alignment**: Reads are aligned using BWA (if FASTQ files are provided).  
4. **Kestrel Genotyping**: Mapping-free genotyping of VNTRs.  
5. **(Optional) adVNTR Genotyping**: Profile-HMM-based method for VNTR genotyping (requires additional setup).  
6. **Summary Report Generation**: A final HTML report is generated to summarize the results.

## Dependencies

VNtyper 2.0 relies on several tools and Python libraries. Ensure that the following dependencies are available in your environment:

- Python >= 3.9  
- BWA  
- Samtools  
- Fastp  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Biopython  
- Pysam  
- Jinja2  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- IGV-Reports  

You can easily set up these dependencies via the provided Conda environment file.

  A[Input: FASTQ/BAM] -->|Quality Control| B[Alignment BWA]

  C --> D[Optional: adVNTR]
  D --> E[Generate Summary Report]
  E --> F[Output: VCF, Summary HTML]
```

## Results

Once the pipeline completes, you will have:

- **BAM or FASTQ** slices containing MUC1-specific reads.  
- **VCF files** or **TSV files** with genotyping results (for Kestrel and optional adVNTR).  
- **HTML summary report** detailing coverage stats, genotyping calls, and relevant logs.

## Notes

1. This tool is for **research use only**.  
2. Ensure **high-coverage WES/WGS or targeted data** is used to genotype MUC1 VNTR accurately.  
3. For questions or issues, refer to the GitHub repository for support.
