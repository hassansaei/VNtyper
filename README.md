# VNtyper 2.0 - A Pipeline to genotype the MUC1-VNTR

**VNtyper 2.0** is an advanced pipeline designed to genotype MUC1 coding Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR) in Autosomal  Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD-MUC1) using Short-Read Sequencing (SRS) data. This version integrates enhanced variant calling algorithms, robust logging mechanisms, and streamlined installation processes to provide researchers with a powerful tool for VNTR analysis.

  - We have developed a web server to provide free access to VNtyper, which runs in the background for ease of use.

## Installation

VNtyper 2.0 can be installed using either `pip` with `setup.py` or via Conda environments for streamlined dependency management.

### Using `setup.py` and `pip`

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   mkdir vntyper
   git clone https://github.com/hassansaei/vntyper.git
   cd vntyper
   pip install .
   ```

---

## Usage

VNtyper 2.0 offers multiple subcommands that can be used depending on your input data and requirements. Below are the main subcommands available:

### 1. Running the Full Pipeline

To run the entire pipeline on paired-end FASTQ files or BAM files:

```bash
vntyper pipeline \
    --config-path /path/to/config.json \
    --fastq1 /path/to/sample_R1.fastq.gz \
    --fastq2 /path/to/sample_R2.fastq.gz \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --threads 4 --fast-mode
```

Alternatively, using a BAM file:

```bash
vntyper pipeline \
    --config-path /path/to/config.json \
    --bam /path/to/sample.bam \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --threads 4 --fast-mode
```
The advntr gentyping is optional and skipped by default. To enable advntr genotyping the ``` --extra-modules advntr ``` option should be used. 

Docker image for vntyper 2.0 is provided and can be pulled and used as follows:

```bash
    docker pull saei/vntyper:2.0.0-alpha.25

    docker run -w /opt/vntyper --rm \
    -v /local/input/folder/:/opt/vntyper/input \
    -v /local/output/folder/:/opt/vntyper/output \
    vntyper:2.0.0-alpha.25 \
    vntyper pipeline --bam /local/input/folder/filename.bam \
    -o /local/output/folder/filename/

```
Apptainer image can be generated from docker image as follows:

```bash
  apptainer pull docker://saei/vntyper:2.0.0-alpha.25  
  
  apptainer run --pwd /opt/vntyper \
    -B /local/input/folder/:/opt/vntyper/input \
    -B /local/output/folder/:/opt/vntyper/output \
    vntyper_2.0.0-alpha.25.sif vntyper pipeline \
    --bam /opt/vntyper/input/filename.bam \
    -o /opt/vntyper/output/filename/ 
```

### 2. Installing References

```bash
vntyper install-references \
    --output-dir /path/to/reference/install \
    --config-path /path/to/config.json \
    --skip-indexing  # Optional: skip BWA indexing if needed
```

### 3. Generating Reports

Generate a summary report for your VNTR genotyping analysis:

```bash
vntyper report \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --config-path /path/to/config.json
```

Process raw FASTQ files to prepare them for genotyping:

```bash
vntyper fastq \
    --fastq1 /path/to/sample_R1.fastq.gz \
    --fastq2 /path/to/sample_R2.fastq.gz \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir
```
```bash
vntyper bam \
    --alignment /path/to/sample.bam \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/dir \
    --threads 4
```

## Pipeline Overview

VNtyper 2.0 integrates multiple steps into a streamlined pipeline. The following is an overview of the steps involved:

1. **FASTQ Quality Control**: Raw FASTQ files are checked for quality.
2. **Alignment**: Reads are aligned using BWA (if FASTQ files are provided).
3. **Kestrel Genotyping**: Mapping-free genotyping of VNTRs.
4. **(Optional) adVNTR Genotyping**: Profile-HMM based method for VNTR genotyping (requires additional setup).
5. **Summary Report Generation**: A final HTML report is generated to summarize the results.

## Dependencies

VNtyper 2.0 relies on several tools and Python libraries. Ensure that the following dependencies are available in your environment:

- Python >= 3.9
- BWA
- Samtools
- Fastp
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Biopython
- Pysam
- Jinja2
- Matplotlib
